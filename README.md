# Getting-Started-with-Deep-Learning
Contains some resources to start deep learning using Tensorflow and PyTorch


For getting started with PyTorch, I would highly recommend referring [Zero to Mastery Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning](https://www.learnpytorch.io/)

And for getting in-depth info about various topics, I find [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) very informative. 

And the offical docs are always there to help you at any given moment, for coding and usage needs;
